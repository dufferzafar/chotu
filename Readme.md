Helps me with all sorts of odd tasks. Linux counterpart to a [similar script](https://github.com/dufferzafar/win-butler/) I had for windows.

Currently this is written only for my needs and has a bunch of hardcoded things and has only been tested on KDE Neon. If you like its features then feel free to create an issue so I can think about making it user extensible.

## features

* Hotstrings (Text Expansion)
    - So when I type `/shrug` it automatically gets converted to `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
    - See [hotstrings.py](hotstrings.py) file 

## todo

* Allow reloading of hotstrings
